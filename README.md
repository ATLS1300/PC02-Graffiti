This assignment allows you to practice your drawing using navigation and  pixel locations to drawing shapes and lines. You'll use the turtle library to modify an image using the code snippets we built during the week.Download this starter repository. In it, you'll find a starter code and this picture of JEFF BEZOS. You may draw whatever you like--positive or negative or whacky imagery. Please keep content appropriate.
<br><br>
(Jeff Bezos is the CEO of Amazon, recently reported to have a net worth of $200 billion dollars (that's: $200,000,000,000,000, or the GDP of Kentucky), making him the richest human in history. Bezos has made ~$5 billion dollars since the start of COVID-19 measures, and has the equivalent wealth of 2.3 million US residents.)
<br><br>
To draw on Jeff Bezos, you may have to move your turtle to different pixel locations. A pixel, short for picture element, is the smallest unit of a picture. Most screens have upwards of 1000 pixels in its longest dimension. 
<br><br>
The start code has some code written for you, to help you get started quickly. The start code sets the drawing window to 750 x 750 pixels, meaning you have 750 pixels horizontally (x), and 750 pixels vertically (y). Remember, the origin (0,0) is at the center of the picture, so to move to the right, your turtle moves forward 375 pixels, and to the left, you'd move -375 pixels. The syntax is shown below.
<br>
myTurtleName.forward(375)
<br><br>
To Jeff Bezos' picture, add at least 2 different geometric shapes - this could be a circle, a polygon (+4 sides), and/or a line.
<br><br>
# For full credit, these shapes must:<br>
1.  have different weights (or thicknesses) of the lines<br>
2.  be drawn at different positions on the screen (you can use goto(x,y) for a specific position, or pick up the pen up() and use forward() and turns (left(), right()) to navigate your turtle)
<br>
<br>
# EXTRA CREDIT
<br>
0.5 pts - create a 3rd shape<br>
0.5 pts - set at least one color using RGB values.<br>
0.5 pts - create one unfilled and one filled shape<br>
